Information about each of the files:

LRMC3-1.Rd:
	The main code for creating and testing the model
	Run "main(year)" to create the model for the given season and count the
	number of correctly predicted bowl games
	Run "multiYearResults()" to create the model for every year from 2002 
	to 2016.
	To run the model for a given year, the game reults file for that year 
	(cfb_years_YEAR-schedule_schedule.csv) and the Common Game information 
	(CGYEAR.csv) for the previous 4 seasons must be present in the working
	 directory.
cfb_years_YEAR-schedule_schedule.csv:
	contains the game results for the given season

CGYEAR.csv:
	the common game information for the given season

LRMC3-1 Results Polls:
	Contains comparisons between the bowl games the LRMC predicted 
	correctly and the games the bowl games that each of the polls 
	predicted correctly.
Table 2:
	Contains comparisons between the bowl games the LRMC predicted 
	correctly and the games the bowl games that each of the other models 
	predicted correctly.

MultiYearBowl Results:
	Contains comparisons between the bowl games the LRMC predicted 
	correctly and the games the bowl games that each of the other models 
	predicted correctly.

PvalueCalculator.py:
	Calculates the p-values for the hypothesis that the LRMC is better than 
	a given model for Table 2 and Table 3

BowlResults/
	Contains comparisons between the bowl games the LRMC predicted 
	correctly and the games the bowl games that each of the other models 
	predicted correctly.

Table3Files/
	Contains comparisons between the bowl games the LRMC predicted 
	correctly and the games the bowl games that each of the other models 
	that missed between 1 and 2 seasons in publishing rangkings.
